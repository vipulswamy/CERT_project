# To explore and understand the BMI of people by countries
### Introduction
Weight is an important contributing factor for Obesity and Heart disease. In this mini project we will try to understand the following:
1. BMI distribution of people across different countries
2. to conclude the hypothesis that a correlation between the countries, their Gender and Obesity levels

### dataset
the dataset consists of the fields, BMI indicators, date
[raw format] : American Samoa,"BMI adults % obese (>=30.0)","%","1/1/2004 0:00",74.6,"WSM"
dataset: https://github.com/irichgreen/BMI_Classification/blob/master/data/ObservationDataiijxxz.csv

### data processing methods
1. Data wranggling
2. Feature extraction
3. Feature engineering
4. Exploratory data analysis
5. Decision about the predictive analysis (Long story short: I skipped, since it did'nt make sense)
6. Conducting the hypotheis testing to understand the dependencies between various Nominal values
